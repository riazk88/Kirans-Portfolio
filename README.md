# Kiran's Portfolio

## About Me
Hi, my name is Kiran! I currently work as a mental health therapist but I am looking to start a career in coding. I live in Salt Lake City, Utah but plan to soon call Austin home. When I am not doing therapy, I spend my time building upon my knowledge of coding. I enjoy reading, playing the violin, working out, and traveling. Want to see my work? Check out my portfolio!
